# Distributed-Displacement-monitoring-Using-Smartphones

1. Developed a distributed multipoint displacement monitoring technique using smartphones based on photogrammetry technology

2. Designed the calibration process to determine the relationship between pixel movement and actual displacement 

3. Developed a mobile application D-Viewer for monitoring the micro displacement of structures 

4. Conducted laboratory experiment and tests and applied the technique to bridge structural health monitoring

5. Published a journal paper
